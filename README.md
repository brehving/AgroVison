AgroVision AI – Smart Crop Monitoring &amp; Irrigation Decision System
🌱 AgroVision AI – Smart Crop Monitoring & Irrigation System

AgroVision AI is an IoT-based smart agriculture project designed to monitor real-time soil and environmental conditions and assist in intelligent irrigation management. The system uses ESP microcontrollers with soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors to collect live field data.

A Crop Stress Index (CSI) algorithm is implemented to evaluate plant health and determine irrigation requirements. Sensor data is transmitted via MQTT (HiveMQ) to a Blynk IoT dashboard for remote monitoring and alert visualization. Data is also logged into CSV files for historical analysis and graph generation.

This project showcases the integration of Embedded Systems, IoT connectivity, and data analytics for precision agriculture and efficient water resource management.
